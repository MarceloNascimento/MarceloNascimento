**Senior Software Engineer | Software Architect | Distributed Systems | Observability | Clouds & AI-Augmented Engineering**

This space reflects how I think, design, and build **real-world, scalable, observable, and resilient software systems**.

Here you will find:
- Production-grade architectures
- Cloud-native services
- Observability-first engineering
- AI-augmented workflows
- Pragmatic, battle-tested solutions

---
## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- ✅ Scalability is not optional  
- ✅ Observability is a first-class feature  
- ✅ Simplicity beats overengineering  
- ✅ Trade-offs matter more than patterns  
- ✅ Systems must fail gracefully  
- ✅ AI is a multiplier, not a replacement  

I design systems that are:
**distributed, observable, fault-tolerant, and business-aligned.**
